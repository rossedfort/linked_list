Evaluator: Sean

* Functional Expectations: 1
  * multiple expectations weren't implemented properly

* Test-Driven Development: 2
  * App was tested, but many assertions were wrong or insufficient, for example,
  the `count` function emptied the list.

* Encapsulation: 1
  * Almost no re-use of code, ultimately caused many bugs

* Ruby & Style: 2
  * Indentation was inconsistent, methods were too long as a result of lack of encapsulation

* Looping or Recursion: 3
  * Showed understanding of a while loop, but not to the point I'd call it excellent

* Personal Notes
  * tests should try to break your code
  * use style guide and adhere to style conventions
