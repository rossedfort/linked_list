* Evaluator: Sean
  * Scores:
    * Functional Expectations: 1
      * multiple expectations weren't implemented properly
    * Test-Driven Development: 2
      * App was tested, but many assertions were wrong or insufficient, for example,
      the `count` function emptied the list.
    * Encapsulation: 1
      * Almost no re-use of code, ultimately caused many bugs
    * Ruby & Style: 2
      * Indentation was inconsistent, methods were too long as a result of lack of encapsulation
    * Looping or Recursion: 3
      * Showed understanding of a while loop, but not to the point I'd call it excellent
