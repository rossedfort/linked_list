README - Linked List

In this project I am creating a linked list (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), and making it fully functional. Full functionality implies that a linked list can do the following:

* Insert elements
* Pop an element from the end
* Push an element onto the beginning
* Remove the (first occurance | all occurances) of an element by data content
* Remove an element by position
* Add an element at an arbitrary position
* Add an element after a known node
* Find whether a data element is or is not in the list
* Find the distance between two nodes
